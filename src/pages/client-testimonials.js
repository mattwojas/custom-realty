            <p>We sincerely appreciate all you have done in our best interest in both selling our house and finding us a new home. You were very pro-active in all areas of the purchase and sale. We found you always to be accessible and very informative, and knowledgeable about the business - and easy to talk to. We were very apprehensive about the whole sales experience but we were very pleased with the outcome, and would recommend Custom Realty Services to anyone. </p>

            <p>We appreciated that in these days and times, someone would go above and beyond their call of duty to help us and make everything stress free.

            <p>We were in our home for over 30 years and downsizing was a difficult decision. Mary was concerned about meeting all of our needs, and patiently answered all of our questions. She made selling and moving to our smaller home an exceptional experience.</p>
